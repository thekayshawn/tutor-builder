# Content Builder - TheTutor.me

A comprehensive, drag-and-drop, content-creation tool that can be used to create about all kinds of textual material.

The app is built on top of create-react-app yet craco is used to override the default webpack configuration in order to allow module aliases.

See package.json for startup scripts.

The app contains a combination of 2 architectural patterns right now.

- The Clean Architecture.
- The Blasted Archirecture.

Blasted is the one that was invigorated by a bunch of developers, each of whom claimed to be "Senior React Engineers" yet they couldn't even structure the app in an organized manner.

I, Kashan Ahmad, have introduced the clean architecture in a procedural manner, newer modules are built in conformation yet there's a ton of work that needs conversion and testing from the other side.

- Core
- Data
- Repos
- Presentation

Those are the 4 layers I've introduced and utilized as part of the clean ecosystem. Typescript is mandatory and there's no excuse for mundane and lazy behaviour.
